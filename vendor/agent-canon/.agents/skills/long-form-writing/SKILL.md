# Long-Form Writing

1. Read `agents/skills/long-form-writing.md`.
1. If the document is a paper, thesis chapter, scholarly note, or symbol-dense academic manuscript, switch to `academic-writing` instead.
1. Fix a short summary statement before drafting: main point, purpose, and intended reader.
1. Build a roadmap and section contract before filling in prose.
1. Draft in reader order and keep long documents scannable.
1. Take a reverse outline after drafting.
1. Require `document_flow_reviewer` and a separate reviewer using `docs-completeness-review`.
1. Add `docs-consistency-review` when the draft changes multiple docs, entrypoints, or canonical routes.
