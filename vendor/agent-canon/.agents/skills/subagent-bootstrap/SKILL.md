# Subagent Bootstrap

1. Start from `agents/TASK_WORKFLOWS.md` and choose the workflow family first.
1. In the first work update, declare `workflow=<family>`, `skills=<...>`, `review=<...>`.
1. Bootstrap a run bundle with `python3 scripts/agent_tools/bootstrap_agent_run.py --task ... --owner ... --workspace-root "$PWD" --enable scheduler --enable schedule_reviewer`.
1. Add `researcher` and `research_reviewer` for research-backed changes, or `infra_steward` and `infra_reviewer` for platform changes.
1. If the runtime supports it, use `/collab` Plan mode before planning and use `/agent` to inspect the Codex subagent inventory.
1. Keep the plan reviewer, detailed design reviewer, and document flow reviewer as separate agent instances.
1. Keep handoff and review state in `reports/agents/<run-id>/` artifacts described by `agents/COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md`.
1. For Claude-native specialists, use `.claude/agents/` as the subagent inventory.
1. Validate role boundaries with `python3 scripts/agent_tools/validate_role_write_scope.py` when a specialist or reviewer writes files.
