# Subagent Bootstrap

1. Read `agents/skills/subagent-bootstrap.md`.
1. Read `agents/canonical/CODEX_SUBAGENTS.md`.
1. For repo-changing tasks, create or inspect a run bundle before implementation.
1. Use `--task-id` so `agents/task_catalog.yaml` expands default specialists and review packs.
1. Keep requirements review, plan review, detailed design review, and document flow review as separate agents.
1. Check the command output for `IMPLEMENTATION_CODEX_AGENTS`.
1. If `IMPLEMENTATION_CODEX_AGENTS` starts with `spark_worker,worker`, send approved, design-traced, low-risk implementation slices to `spark_worker` first.
1. Send broad implementation, design interpretation, conflict resolution, or architecture-sensitive work to `worker`.
1. Use one writer per worktree. If multiple writers are necessary, split worktrees before implementation.
1. For each new user request, start fresh run-local subagents; do not `send_input` a new task into subagents from a previous request.
1. Include `team_manifest.yaml` `run.subagent_lifecycle_policy` in every subagent handoff prompt, especially `fresh_subagents_required: true` and `reuse_for_new_task: forbidden`.
1. Before closeout, close run-local subagents and record `subagents_closed=yes` plus `Subagent Lifecycle Evidence` in `closeout_gate.md`.
