# Agent Learning

1. Read `agents/skills/agent-learning.md`.
1. Read `agents/workflows/agent-learning-workflow.md`.
1. Separate user preference from agent-side learning.
1. Record observable behavior with `python3 tools/agent_tools/workflow_monitor.py --report-dir reports/agents/<run-id> --behavior-event "..."`, including skill invocation, subagent routing, tool gates, prompt evals, review feedback, subagent lifecycle, and diff-check decisions.
1. Before closeout, run `python3 tools/agent_tools/evaluate_agent_run.py --report-dir reports/agents/<run-id> --behavior-manifest agents/evals/agent_behavior_eval.toml --write` and resolve any feedback actions.
1. Log concise evidence-backed observations with `tools/agent_tools/log_agent_learning.py`.
1. Keep raw chat out of notes; record source, evidence, scope, and confidence.
1. Promote only stable items into `AGENTS.md`, workflow docs, or guardrails.
