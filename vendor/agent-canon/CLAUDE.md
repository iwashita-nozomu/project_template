# Claude Code

- Shared project instructions live in `AGENTS.md` and `agents/canonical/README.md`.
- CLI-specific shared canon lives in `agents/canonical/CLI_ENTRYPOINTS.md`.
- Claude-compatible shared skills live in `.claude/skills/` and are synced from `.agents/skills/`.
- Claude-specific subagents live in `.claude/agents/`.
- If shared instructions already exist in `AGENTS.md`, prefer importing or linking instead of duplicating them.
