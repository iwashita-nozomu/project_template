# Dependency Analysis

1. Read `documents/dependency-manifest-design.md`.
1. Choose the smallest mode that answers the task:
   - changed-file closeout gate: use `--changed`
   - explicit file review: pass file paths explicitly
   - repo migration inventory: run full scan without `--changed`
   - dependency edge change: include graph validation
1. For changed human-authored text files, run:

```bash
python3 tools/agent_tools/check_dependency_headers.py --changed
bash tools/agent_tools/scan_dependency_headers.sh --changed --fail-missing
bash tools/agent_tools/check_dependency_header_format.sh --changed --require-header
```

1. When dependency edges were added or changed, run:

```bash
bash tools/agent_tools/check_dependency_graph.sh --changed --print-edges
```

1. When reverse-edge migration is the task, add strict bidirectional validation:

```bash
bash tools/agent_tools/check_dependency_graph.sh --changed --print-edges --check-bidirectional
```

1. For full-repo migration inventory, run report-only scan first:

```bash
bash tools/agent_tools/scan_dependency_headers.sh
```

1. For full graph baseline, run:

```bash
bash tools/agent_tools/check_dependency_graph.sh --print-edges
```

1. Treat changed-file header / scan / format failures as fix-now blockers.
1. Treat default graph failures as fix-now blockers because they indicate isolated manifests, self references, or cycles.
1. Do not make Dockerfile or environment files universal anchors. Use the nearest true canon anchor (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, directory README, workflow/design doc, tool index, skill guide) unless the file actually depends on Docker, CI, requirements, or runtime configuration.
1. During reverse-edge migration, `--check-bidirectional` failures may be a baseline, but do not call them pass. Record the baseline and confirm the current diff introduced no new old-format header, self reference, missing reverse edge, kind mismatch, or cycle.
1. Put command outputs and any baseline decision in `verification.txt` and `closeout_gate.md`.
