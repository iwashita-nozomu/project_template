# Codex Task Workflow

1. Read `agents/canonical/CODEX_WORKFLOW.md`.
1. On a clean worktree, run `make agent-canon-ensure-latest` before planning or implementation; if dirty, record why it is blocked and rerun after commit or stash.
1. Sweep `documents/`, `notes/`, `references/`, and local implementation directories before planning or implementation.
1. Classify the task with `agents/TASK_WORKFLOWS.md` before touching files.
1. In the first work update, declare `workflow=<family>`, `skills=<...>`, `review=<...>`.
1. When skills are explicitly named in the task or handoff, use `$skill-name` notation and preserve it in `skills=<...>`.
1. During requirements, resolve avoidable ambiguity from notes, guardrails, documents, prior logs, and local code or tests before asking the user; record the sweep and evidence in `user_request_contract.md`.
1. Keep `unknown_or_open_question` out of active must-do, must-not-do, and completion-evidence clauses; move remaining unknowns to deferred or escalation entries after the sweep.
1. For repo-editing tasks, bootstrap subagents before implementation with `python3 tools/agent_tools/bootstrap_agent_run.py ... --enable scheduler --enable schedule_reviewer`, and keep the plan reviewer, detailed design reviewer, and document flow reviewer separate.
1. Use `agents/canonical/ARTIFACT_PLACEMENT.md` before creating task-facing documents.
1. Load only the minimal extra skills the task needs; long-form docs add `long-form-writing`, and academic papers or thesis chapters add `academic-writing` plus notation/logic review.
1. If the task needs explicit handoff or specialist roles, bootstrap `reports/agents/<run-id>/` first.
1. Update canonical docs before runtime entrypoints when both are affected.
1. Before implementation, read the approved `design_brief.md` `Implementation Source Packet` and `Design-To-Implementation Trace`; cite the design artifact path, design section, test-plan item, and user-request clause IDs for each changed slice.
1. If the design trace is missing or conflicts with repo docs or code, return to detailed design review instead of editing from chat context.
1. Under rate-limit pressure, move only fully design-traced, low-risk implementation slices to `spark_worker`; keep requirements, design, review, and scope judgment off Spark.
1. Validate with `make ci-quick` first and escalate to broader checks only when needed.
