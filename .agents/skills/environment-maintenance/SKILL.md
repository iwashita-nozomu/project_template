# Environment Maintenance

1. Treat `docker/` as the shared environment canon.
1. Update `docker/packs/*.toml`, `docker/codex-container-profiles.toml`, and `docker/python-execution-rules.toml` when runtime selection behavior changes.
1. Start from `agents/templates/environment_change_proposal.md` when proposing a new repo-wide tool or dependency.
1. Update dependency definitions and related docs in the same change.
1. Check CI and local validation commands together.
1. Use `documents/coding-conventions-project.md`, `documents/WORKFLOW_INVENTORY.md`, and `docker/README.md`.
1. Do not canonize host-global installs as the repository default.
