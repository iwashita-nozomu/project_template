## Reader Map

- This template owns the PR checklist for AgentCanon changes made through a template or derived repository.
- Use `PR Essence`, `Summary`, and `Scope` to state the change route; use the branch, authority, automation, plan, orchestration, issue, validation, integration, sync, mirror, and risk sections for required evidence.
- Read it when preparing or reviewing a template-side PR that changes shared canon surfaces or updates an AgentCanon pin/root view.

## PR Essence

- Problem / user request:
- Design intent:
- Canonical owner:
- Behavior or contract delta:
- Evidence route:
- Replaceable responsibility unit:
- Public/API/schema impact:
- Explicit non-goals:

## Dependency Closure

- upstream design / contract:
- implementation owner and source path:
- downstream consumers:
- changed dependency edges and why they are closed:
- intentionally unchanged adjacent surfaces:

## Candidate Commit And Publication Identity

- `origin/main` merge-base:
- candidate commit:
- local HEAD:
- pushed branch:
- PR head:
- local = push = PR head evidence:
- submodule / generated projection identity:

## Summary

- changed shared canon surfaces:
- why shared canon needs this change:
- derived repo or template issue that exposed the need:
- AgentCanon source PR:
- template PR:

## Scope

- [ ] This PR edits `vendor/agent-canon/` as the source of truth.
- [ ] This PR does not mix repo-local implementation work with shared canon changes.
- [ ] Root symlink views were not edited directly.
- [ ] Standalone AgentCanon PR checklist was considered when the change should land in `iwashita-nozomu/agent-canon` first.
- [ ] Template / derived repo PR routing is separated from standalone AgentCanon repository PR routing.

## Branch And Change Route

- [ ] AgentCanon source change was pushed to a dedicated GitHub branch before this template / derived PR.
- [ ] Tool additions or tool behavior changes are represented by an AgentCanon source PR, not only by this template pin/root-view PR.
- [ ] Memory additions, agent-learning updates, skill eval results, or feedback-loop changes are represented by an AgentCanon source PR, not only by this template pin/root-view PR.
- [ ] This PR is a pin/root-view update after the AgentCanon source PR, or the deferred upstream-sync reason is documented below.
- [ ] This PR records `agentcanon_structure_followup=required` for AgentCanon source, pin, root-view, root-copy, or parent sync changes.

Route notes:

## PR Mutation Authority

- [ ] This PR only required inspection, branch push, PR creation, title/body update, evidence comments, draft-state preservation, or conversion to draft.
- [ ] Merge / close / ready-for-review / reviewer request / review dismissal / auto-merge / branch deletion was explicitly authorized by the user for this task, or was not performed.
- [ ] If merge, close, or ready-for-review is still required, the blocker and required human/maintainer action are recorded below instead of being guessed from `gh` availability.
- [ ] If `pr_mutation_authority: github_copilot_merge_when_green` is used, the PR has Copilot-visible evidence and local Codex did not perform the merge.

Authority / blocker notes:

## Copilot / Automation Output

- goal `pr_mutation_authority`:
- `COPILOT_PR_AUTHORITY=`:
- `COPILOT_PR_DECISION=`:
- `COPILOT_PR_CHECKS=`:
- `COPILOT_VISIBLE_EVIDENCE=`:
- `COPILOT_BLOCKER=`:
- `gh pr checks` summary:

## Plan Mode Evidence

- [ ] Plan mode was used before non-trivial AgentCanon sync, Copilot, PR-template, GitHub Actions, or shared runtime-surface changes.
- [ ] Written plan is included in the PR body, issue, run bundle, or linked comment when the runtime did not expose an explicit Plan mode.
- [ ] Trivial-change exception is explained below when Plan mode was not used.

Plan / exception:

## Agent Orchestration Evidence

- [ ] First work update, run bundle, or linked PR comment recorded `workflow=<family>`, `skills=$agent-orchestration,...`, and `review=<...>` before implementation.
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/route.py --prompt "<user request>" --format json` was reviewed, or the no-repo-task / routing-only exception is recorded below.
- [ ] If `$agent-orchestration` was not selected first, this PR is paused until the exception is explicit and reviewed.

Orchestration evidence:

## Review Adjudication

- reviewer roles / identities:
- review findings:
- adjudication for each finding: accepted / rejected / deferred:
- rejected rationale and governing contract:
- unresolved blocker and owner:
- final review decision: pass / revise / escalate:

## Operational Findings / Issues

- [ ] `vendor/agent-canon/issues//README.md` was reviewed.
- [ ] Existing durable findings were searched in `vendor/agent-canon/issues//open/`, `vendor/agent-canon/issues//closed/`, `vendor/agent-canon/memory/`, `vendor/agent-canon/notes/failures/`, relevant workflow docs, and prior run-bundle evidence when available.
- [ ] New user / reviewer / runtime / CI workflow defect findings were written to `vendor/agent-canon/issues//open/AC-YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md`, `vendor/agent-canon/memory/`, or `vendor/agent-canon/notes/failures/` before closeout.
- [ ] Structure intake, responsibility-scope, or dependency-review evidence used to choose the fix surface is cited below.
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/issue_sync.py --repo iwashita-nozomu/agent-canon --github-check` was run; any missing GitHub mirrors are listed as `ISSUE_SYNC_PLAN=` or intentionally deferred.
- [ ] No new durable operational finding is required, and the reason is stated below.
- [ ] Agent Improvement Guide artifact from `.github/workflows/agent-improvement-guide.yml` was reviewed when available.
- [ ] Issue Mirror artifact / Step Summary from `.github/workflows/issue-mirror.yml` was reviewed when available.

Issue / edit-scope evidence:

## Copilot Configuration Impact

- [ ] `vendor/agent-canon/documents//codex/github-copilot-configuration.md` was
  reviewed in template roots, or `documents/codex/github-copilot-configuration.md`
  was reviewed in standalone AgentCanon.
- [ ] Existing Copilot instruction surfaces changed / reviewed / not affected.
- [ ] Optional future `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, or `.github/agents/*.md` surfaces were not introduced accidentally.
- [ ] GitHub Copilot MCP, `copilot-setup-steps.yml`, or Copilot environment settings changed / reviewed / not affected.
- [ ] PR template routing still separates this template / derived repo AgentCanon-pin PR from standalone AgentCanon repository PRs.

Impact notes:

## Validation

- [ ] Validation failure response, if any, cites `vendor/agent-canon/documents//runtime/runtime-profiles-and-check-matrix.json` as the canonical taxonomy owner; `vendor/agent-canon/documents//runtime/runtime-profiles-and-check-matrix.md` is the generated reader projection. PR evidence records the required evidence and same-intent repair / escalation result.
- [ ] `bash tools/agent-canon//sync_agent_canon.sh link-root`
- [ ] `bash tools/agent-canon//sync_agent_canon.sh check`
- [ ] `make agent-canon-pr-check`
- [ ] `bash tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/run_repo_dependency_review.sh --fail-missing`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/check_agent_runtime_alignment.py`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/evaluate_skill_workflow_prompts.py --manifest evidence/agent-evals/skill_workflow_prompt_eval.toml`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/check_convention_compliance.py`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/tool_catalog.py`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/tool_drift.py`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/responsibility_scope.py`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/issue_sync.py --repo iwashita-nozomu/agent-canon --github-check`
- [ ] `python3 tools/agent-canon//agent_tools/eval_accumulation_check.py`
- [ ] fresh `skill_evaluator@gpt-5.4-mini` validation evidence when evaluator review is in scope
- [ ] AgentCanon pin/update path: `bash tools/agent-canon//update_agent_canon.sh rebuild-tools` or a documented `AGENT_CANON_TOOL_REBUILD_*` skip reason.
- [ ] GitHub workflow / PR template changes: `python3 tools/agent-canon//ci/check_github_workflows.py`
- [ ] GitHub workflow changes: every `actions/checkout` job uses `submodules: false`, then runs `.github/scripts/checkout_agent_canon_submodule.sh` in template / derived roots or `tools/agent-canon/ci/checkout_agent_canon_submodule.sh` in standalone AgentCanon source when AgentCanon is needed.
- [ ] Private AgentCanon submodule access is covered by repository secret `AGENT_CANON_REPO_TOKEN`, `AGENT_CANON_REPO_SSH_KEY` from a read-only deploy key, or the PR explains why the workflow does not need it.
- [ ] GitHub workflow changes: `persist-credentials: false` is set unless the job has documented write intent.
- [ ] GitHub workflow changes: `permissions:` is set at workflow or job level.
- [ ] GitHub workflow changes: `concurrency:` is present or explicitly not needed.

## Validation Trust Boundary And Format

- validation command:
- what the command proves:
- what it cannot prove:
- production behavior versus test-only evidence:
- format / lint / parse result:
- artifact path, producer, digest, and readback:
- validation failure semantics and escalation:

## Shared Surface Changes

- new surfaces:
- removed surfaces:
- root copy surfaces touched:
- link spec changes:
- `.gitmodules` changed / reviewed:
- generated copy/form producer:
- generated paths read back:

## Integration

- [ ] No file-structure change is included
- [ ] File-structure change is included and `agents/workflows/main-integration-workflow.md` will be used

Integration notes:

## Upstream Sync

- [ ] AgentCanon source PR was opened and merged before this template pin update, or this is a pin-only update to existing AgentCanon `main`.
- [ ] After AgentCanon merge, ran `make agent-canon-ensure-latest`.
- [ ] Compiled AgentCanon tools were rebuilt by the latest/ensure path, or `AGENT_CANON_TOOL_REBUILD_*` explains why rebuild is deferred to DevContainer.
- [ ] `agentcanon_structure_followup=required` is recorded for this parent pin/root-view PR.
- [ ] Ran `bash tools/agent-canon//sync_agent_canon.sh link-root` and `bash tools/agent-canon//sync_agent_canon.sh check` from the template / derived parent root.
- [ ] `agentcanon_structure_followup=pass` is recorded only after both parent-root sync commands passed.
- [ ] Direct `bash tools/agent-canon//sync_agent_canon.sh push` was not used, or a maintainer direct-push exception is explained below.
- [ ] Any upstream sync blocker is recorded below; deferred sync is not PR completion evidence for AgentCanon source/pin/root-view changes.

Upstream sync note:

## Artifact And Clone Cleanup

- temporary clone/worktree paths:
- run-local reports and raw logs:
- generated artifacts retained:
- cleanup command and owner:
- cleanup result / explicit preservation reason:

## Submodule Pin Change

- [ ] Template `vendor/agent-canon` pin changed.
- [ ] Template `vendor/agent-canon` pin unchanged.

Pin unchanged justification:

## GitHub Mirror / Submodule Evidence

- AgentCanon GitHub repo: `iwashita-nozomu/agent-canon`
- Template GitHub repo:
- template PR URL:
- AgentCanon PR URL or commit:
- template `vendor/agent-canon` pin:
- AgentCanon GitHub `main` SHA:
- AgentCanon GitHub SHA:
- template submodule SHA:
- template GitHub `main` SHA:
- local bare mirror SHA:
- `git submodule status vendor/agent-canon`:
- branch protection / vulnerability alert / Dependabot status:
- GitHub Actions workflow affected:
- private AgentCanon submodule secret affected:
- PR checklist affected:

## Risks

- stale route risk:
- backward drift risk:
- reviewer focus:
